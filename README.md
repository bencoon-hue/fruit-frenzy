🍓 Fruit Frenzy

Fruit Frenzy is a fast-paced fruit-catching game built in Unity, inspired by Apple Picker but expanded with multiple fruit types, combo scoring, and difficulty scaling.
Your goal: catch as many good fruits as possible while avoiding bad ones. The longer you survive, the faster things get — and once you hit Fruit Frenzy Mode, it’s pure chaos! 🍌🍎🍇

Avoid Bad Fruits 💀 – Catching rotten fruits costs you a life.

Difficulty Scaling ⏫ – Fruit speed and spawn rate increase as your score grows.

Fruit Frenzy Mode ⚡ – Unlocks at 1000 points for rapid fruit drops and huge combo potential!

Game Over 💔 – Miss 3 fruits or catch 3 bad ones, and the game resets.
